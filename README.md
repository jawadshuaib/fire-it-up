# üî• FIRE IT UP! - A Monte Carlo Retirement Simulator

Welcome to **FIRE IT UP!**, a web-based application designed to help you plan for Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) by calculating a sustainable, inflation-adjusted annual withdrawal from your investment portfolio.

## üöÄ About The Project

This tool goes beyond simple retirement calculators that use a fixed annual return. Instead, **FIRE IT UP!** uses **Monte Carlo simulations** to model market volatility and provide a probability-based forecast for your portfolio's longevity.

The primary goal is to calculate the **maximum safe annual withdrawal amount** that your portfolio can sustain, ensuring the funds last until your specified life expectancy with a high degree of confidence (e.g., a 90% success rate).

### How It Works

1.  **Input Your Data**: Define your investment assets (principal, expected return, risk level) and global settings (retirement age, life expectancy, estimated inflation).
2.  **Run the Simulation**: The app runs thousands of unique retirement simulations. In each run, annual market returns for your assets are randomized based on their specified risk profiles.
3.  **Analyze the Outcomes**: It calculates the highest possible annual withdrawal that doesn't deplete your portfolio before your target age in at least 90% of all simulated scenarios.
4.  **Visualize the Future**: The results are displayed as an interactive chart showing the median (50th percentile), best-case (90th percentile), and worst-case (10th percentile) portfolio projections over time.

## Structure

The project is organized into a modular component structure:

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/         # Reusable React components (Forms, Charts, UI elements)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/              # Custom React hooks (e.g., usePortfolio for state management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           # Core business logic (e.g., simulation.ts)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts            # Shared TypeScript types and interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.ts        # Global constants
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx             # Main application component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # The single HTML entry point
